#object oriented programming. 

#Object oriented programming tries to model a real world object when programming.
#each of the model componenents provide aspects or charactersistics of the object itself
#what it has, what it does

#what it has > attributes attributes are a variable; what is associated with the object

#what it does > methods > function > called method because it is something a particular model object can do. 

#an object is a way to combine data and functionality

#a class is the overarching group of instances for a given object type. 

#for example, when modeling a restaurant, the waiter would be a class that combines variable data and methods to perform prescribed tasks

#object has attributes that are specific to the object itself. 
#objects has functions that are associated with that object > called a method. 

#new object from package pretty table
#table = PrettyTable()
#table.add_column("Pokemon Name",["Pikachu","Squirtle","Charmander","Bulbasaur"])
#adding columns using the add_columns method passing in the column name, and list of instances.
#table.add_column("type",["Electric","Water","Fire","Grass"])

#changing alignment to left alignment
#table.align = "l"
